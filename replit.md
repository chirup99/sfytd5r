# Overview

This project is a full-stack trading platform providing real-time market data analysis, AI-powered trading insights, and a social feed. It utilizes the "BATTU API" for pattern recognition and trading signal generation based on a 4-candle rule methodology across multiple timeframes. The platform also integrates an AI agent with web search for financial queries and a unified sharing system for trading journal reports, allowing users to preview and share performance metrics. The business vision is to empower traders with sophisticated analytical tools, AI-driven insights, and a collaborative community to enhance decision-making.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

**Framework**: React with TypeScript, Vite
**UI/UX**: Radix UI components with Tailwind CSS for a mobile-first, responsive design using shadcn/ui patterns. Features include bottom navigation for mobile and sidebar for desktop.
**State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state and real-time data updates.
**Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing.

## Backend Architecture

**Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js (TypeScript)
**API Pattern**: RESTful endpoints.
**Core Services**:
- **BATTU Analysis Engine**: Implements the 4-candle rule with recursive C2 block drilling for multi-timeframe pattern detection.
- **Market Data Service**: Fetches real-time and historical data.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies uptrend/downtrend using Point A/B analysis.
- **Slope Calculator**: Provides precise slope calculations.
- **Trade Validation**: Applies timing rules for breakout detection.
**System Design**: Stateless API, separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, and caching strategies for performance.

## Data Storage

**Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon serverless), AWS DynamoDB (for NeoFeed social features)
**ORM**: Drizzle ORM with TypeScript schema definitions (`shared/schema.ts`).
**Data Models**: User accounts, trading signals, cached market data, social feed posts, and user trading journal data.

## Authentication & Authorization

**Strategy**: AWS Cognito for NeoFeed social features, session-based for other features.
**User Management**: AWS Cognito handles user registration, login, and profile management with auto-confirmation (no email verification required). 
**NeoFeed Authentication Flow**: Username/password stored locally (currentUsername), profile data synced with DynamoDB user-profiles table.

## NeoFeed AWS Migration (Complete)

**Primary Data Source**: AWS DynamoDB (eu-north-1 region)
**Tables**:
- `neofeed-user-posts`: Social feed posts with author info, content, media
- `neofeed-likes`: Track user likes (pk: postId, sk: userId)
- `neofeed-retweets`: Track reposts (pk: postId, sk: userId)
- `neofeed-comments`: Post comments with author info
- `neofeed-user-profiles`: User profile data (displayName, bio, avatar)
- `neofeed-follows`: Follower/following relationships (pk: followerId, sk: followingId)
- `neofeed-audio-posts`: Audio minicast posts
- `neofeed-banners`: Feed banner content

**API Endpoints**:
- Follow: `POST /api/users/:username/follow` (requires currentUsername in body)
- Unfollow: `POST /api/users/:username/unfollow`
- Follow Status: `GET /api/users/:username/follow-status?currentUsername=xxx`
- Follower Count: `GET /api/users/:username/followers-count`
- Like/Unlike: `POST/DELETE /api/social-posts/:id/like` (requires userId in body)
- Repost: `POST/DELETE /api/social-posts/:id/repost` (requires userId in body)
- Comment: `POST /api/social-posts/:id/comment`

## Key Architectural Patterns

- **BATTU 4-Candle Rule Methodology**: Involves data collection, block formation, Point A/B detection, pattern classification, slope calculation, timing validation, and recursive analysis (80min down to 5min).
- **Demo Mode**: Allows users to switch between shared demo data (Google Cloud Storage) and personal trading data (Firebase Firestore), with access controls for saving and deleting formats based on authentication status.
- **Audio MiniCast**: Enables users to create audio-based content from feed posts by selecting up to 5 posts, which are then displayed as swipeable cards with play controls in the feed.

## AI Trading Agent Enhancements (December 2025)

**Real-Time Data Integration**:
- Uses Angel One API when authenticated for live market prices
- Falls back gracefully to Yahoo Finance when Angel One is not connected
- All stock queries include related news from Google News RSS

**Real Quarterly Performance Data**:
- `EnhancedFinancialScraper` scrapes real quarterly data from Moneycontrol and NSE
- Replaces random placeholder data with actual quarterly performance metrics
- Calculates real trends based on scraped financial data

**Stock Comparison Tool**:
- Properly fetches and displays data for ALL compared stocks
- Includes quarterly performance, trend analysis, and recent news for each stock
- Returns chart-ready data with PE, EPS, and recommendation for each stock
