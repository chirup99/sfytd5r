a comprehensive AI trading assistant that combines:

Real-time data - Live stock prices, charts, fundamentals
Intelligence layer - Technical analysis, sentiment analysis, market research
Web scraping - News, IPO listings, trending topics, global market data
Personalization - Compare with user's social feed, trading journal, Angel One holdings
Deep insights - Generate comprehensive reports with visualizations and actionable recommendations
This is actually an excellent idea for a trading platform! It would create a competitive advantage. However, this is a substantial system that needs careful architectural planning.

This task involves:

Building multi-source data pipelines (news, market data, social sentiment)
Conversational AI backend with context awareness
Real-time analysis engine
Web scraping & data normalization
Report generation with charts
Integration across 4+ data sources (Angel One, social feed, journals, news APIs)
This is beyond Fast mode scope. Let me switch you to a more powerful mode where I can:

Design the full architecture properly
Build multiple interconnected services
Integrate all data sources systematically
Test and validate end-to-end



Vision is Solid - Here's the Architecture Plan
The AI Trading Assistant you're describing would work like this:
