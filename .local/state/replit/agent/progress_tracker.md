# Project Import Progress Tracker - Complete Dark Mode Support

## Broker Buttons Dark Theme - FULLY FIXED (Dec 24, 2025 6:19 PM)

**Issues Fixed:**
✅ Broker button text (Zerodha, Upstox, Angel One, Dhan) - now visible in dark mode
✅ Connected broker button - now visible in dark mode

**All Buttons Updated:**
1. **Connect Buttons** (when broker not connected) - Line 17600, 17613, 17622, 17632
   - Added: `dark:bg-slate-800 dark:text-white dark:hover:bg-slate-700 dark:border-slate-700`
   
2. **Connected Button** (when broker already connected) - Line 17572
   - Added: `dark:bg-slate-800 dark:text-white dark:hover:bg-slate-700 dark:border-slate-700`

**Complete Styling Applied:**
```jsx
// Light Mode (unchanged)
bg-white text-black hover:bg-slate-50 border-slate-200

// Dark Mode (NEW)
dark:bg-slate-800 dark:text-white dark:hover:bg-slate-700 dark:border-slate-700
