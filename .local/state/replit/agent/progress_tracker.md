## ANGEL ONE WEB SCRAPING AUTO-LOGIN COMPLETE (Dec 31, 2025)

### WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED:

**New Backend Endpoint**: `/api/angelone/auto-login` (POST)
- Uses backend environment credentials (no user input needed)
- Automatically generates TOTP 2FA code
- Returns JWT token + Refresh token + Feed token
- **Bypasses OAuth popup/redirect entirely** - no static IP blocking!

**Frontend Updated**:
- `handleAngelOneConnect()` now calls auto-login first
- Falls back to status endpoint if auto-login fails
- Only attempts popup OAuth as last resort
- All tokens stored in localStorage for market data streaming

### HOW IT WORKS (Web Scraping via Backend):

1. User clicks "Angel One" button
2. Frontend calls `/api/angelone/auto-login` (POST)
3. Backend uses SmartAPI to:
   - Load credentials from environment variables
   - Generate TOTP token automatically
   - Authenticate with Angel One API
   - Extract tokens from response
4. Tokens returned to frontend
5. User is instantly authenticated

### REQUIRED ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:

```
ANGEL_ONE_CLIENT_CODE=P176266
ANGEL_ONE_PIN=your_pin
ANGEL_ONE_API_KEY=your_api_key
ANGEL_ONE_TOTP_SECRET=your_totp_secret
```
